I did my undergrad in Sharif University in Software Engineering and my PhD at Stanford University in Operations Research and Computer Science and my postdoc at MIT during which I worked as a consultant for Accenture. During this time, I have published several papers in the top journal of OR, namely Operations Research as well as various top tier conferences both in machine learning and optimization.

Post academia, I have worked at Meta as a research scientist. During my tenure at Meta, I have worked closely with Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and Core Data Science (CDS) where I analyzed a vast amount of data and have worked with different machine learning, optimization, and experimentation tools.

 <h1>Bio</h1>
 <br>
 <p>
I did my undergrad in Sharif University in Software Engineering and my PhD at Stanford University in Operations Research and Computer Science and my postdoc at MIT during which I worked as a consultant for Accenture. During this time, I have published several papers in the top journal of OR, namely Operations Research as well as various top tier conferences both in machine learning and optimization. Throughout my Ph.D. I have worked in several labs including Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Citadel as a quantitative researcher.

<br> <br>

Post academia, I have worked at Meta as an applied research scientist. During my tenure at Meta, I have worked closely with Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and Core Data Science (CDS) where I analyzed a vast amount of data and have worked with different machine learning, optimization, and experimentation tools to conduct impactful research. You can learn more about me in my <a href="./resume.pdf">CV</a>.
